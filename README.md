# Simple & Secure Password Generator by Alper Celik
### Wrote an algorithm in Python to create 12-character unique passwords without using rand() method due to security vulnerabilities. Implemented Graphical User Interface (GUI) using Tkinter Framework to make the password generator user-friendly.

#### The 'secrets' module in Python provides a more secure way of generating random numbers compared to the 'random' module's rand function. 
#### The secrets module uses a *cryptographically secure pseudorandom number generator* that is designed to be more resistant to prediction and bias attacks.
